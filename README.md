Contained here is the code used in my final year project: Monte Carlo Simulations of the Ising Model on Random Graphs

SpinGraphs.cpp and the corresponding header file contain most of the functions used throughout, while the primary file used for data generation is ssCorrelation.cpp. The other .cpp files contain some modifications for the purposes of some minor investigations.

Contained in the python files is most of the data analysis work
